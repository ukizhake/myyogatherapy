tips,,,,
tip 1,When we work on any physical exercise – the exchange of gases at a cellular level / tissue level (tissue as a group of cells). Your tissues need oxygen and glucose. If they have adequate amounts of both they will function well. Tissues will form carbon dioxide which builds up with exercise. When you perform pranayama you enhance the efficacy of your lungs. Most people work only 10%! So if we increase it to 20% you’ve given a 100% improvement therefore the tissues will get a better delivery of oxygen. You have a competent system. Then there is an acid alkaline balance. When muscles are tired the body is in survival mode. The pranayama enhances the capacity so gives optimum endurance.,,,
tip 2,The kumbhaka – held in techniques slow down the system therefore the more efficient it is.,,,
